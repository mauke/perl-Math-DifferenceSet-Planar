=head1 NAME

pds_find_delta - find pairs of difference set elements with given difference

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pds_find_delta delta [file]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This example program reads planar difference sets, one per line, as
integer numbers separated by whitespace, finds in each set the pair of
elements with the difference specified on the command line, and writes
those elements to standard output.

Note that the delta value will be normalized with respect to the modulus
of each set.

The program will fail with an error message if an input line is not a set
containing such a pair, which also indicates it is not a difference set.
Searching for a zero difference will yield a random element twice.
