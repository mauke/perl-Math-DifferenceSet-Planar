=head1 NAME

pds_planes - enumerate planar difference sets of a given order

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pds_planes p n
  pds_planes order

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This example program writes planar difference sets of a given order
to standard output.  The order can be specified as a prime number and
an exponent, or as a prime power.  The output will be lines with one
representative difference set per line, for all planes of the given order.
