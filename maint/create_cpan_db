This file is the default database distributed with the Perl 5 module
Math::DifferenceSet::Planar.

It contains $COUNT cyclic planar difference set planes with orders ranging
from 2 to $MAX.  The planes include std, lex and gap reference sets.
For the definition of std reference sets, consult the documentation
of L<Math::DifferenceSet::Planar>.  Lex reference sets are minimal
by lexicographic ordering with priority on small over large elements,
so that {0, 1, 3, 9} ranks before {0, 1, 4, 6}.  Gap reference sets
are minimal by lexicographic ordering with priority on large over small
elements, so that {2, 3, 5} ranks before {0, 4, 5}.  The database also
contains planar difference set space data for the same range of orders.
The radices are chosen with the algorithm given in the example program
pds_find_space.
