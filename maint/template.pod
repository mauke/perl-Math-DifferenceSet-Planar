=head1 FILE FORMAT

SQLite 3.x database.

=head1 SCHEMA

  CREATE TABLE difference_set (
    order_   integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    base     integer NOT NULL,
    exponent integer NOT NULL,
    modulus  integer NOT NULL,
    n_planes integer NOT NULL,
    deltas   blob    NOT NULL
  );

=head1 DATA REPRESENTATION

If I<D = { d_1, d_2, ..., d_k } (mod m)> is a canonical cyclic
planar difference set of order I<k - 1> with I<d_1 E<8801> 0> and
I<d_2 E<8801> 1 (mod m)>, I<deltas> is a sequence of I<k - 2> numeric
values packed in 'w*' format, calculated as differences of consecutive
residue values of I<D> starting with I<d_3 - d_2>.  The difference of
the smallest two values in a canonical set is always 1 and thus not
important to store.
