This file is a supplement to the default database distributed
with the Perl 5 module Math::DifferenceSet::Planar.

It contains one huge cyclic planar difference set of order 2096993,
generated from the polynomial x^3+x-11.
Note that this is not the Conway polynomial, x^3+3*x-3, as the set was
generated before we chose to prefer Conway polynomials for samples.
