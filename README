Math-DifferenceSet-Planar version 0.004
=======================================

A planar difference set in a finite group (G, +) is a subset D of G
with the property that any nonzero element of G can be represented as a
difference of two elements of D in exactly one way.  If D has k elements
there are k × (k - 1) differences of unequal elements of D and thus
k² - k + 1 elements in G.  Planar difference sets are known to exist
in modular integer groups where k - 1 is a prime power.  As these finite
groups are cyclic these sets are called cyclic planar difference sets.

This library provides examples of small planar difference sets and
iterators over all known sets of a given size.  It comes with a database
of pre-computed samples.  Larger databases are available separately.
